Today we started working on our pokemon projects. We have to recreate the intro to pokemon red. For extra credit you can also put in images and make the text come in slowly. Right now I am working on getting th text into the program and also working on putting an input name into one of the pther sentences, but so far this is pretty easy. Its just a lot of copying and pasting texts and also a lot of prints but  you can complete this program with only prints and inputs.

We made a calculator that put numbers into a list and then added them together. I almost created the list by myself but I needed some help. The probem was that it was put in as string and not as an interger.
